Abstract:The Southwestern Atlantic is one of the largest regional management units of the sea turtle Caretta caretta due to its unique mitochondrial lineages diverging from others worldwide. However, despite its importance, their life history remains elusive and poorly studied. Compiling mitochondrial (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) datasets, in this study, we retraced the SWA C. caretta life history through multidisciplinary approaches to infer the consequences of the evolutionary processes on their current genetic diversity and structure and contemporary and historical demography. The migration and gene flow results evidenced that none of the nesting areas are completely isolated but, indeed, the ES is the great propagule donor for other nesting areas. Furthermore, the demographic analysis detected recent bottleneck events for the SWA C. caretta, demonstrating that each nesting area presents a distinct demographic history with specific genetic signals from both datasets which influence their current genetic diversity, population structure and Ne.
