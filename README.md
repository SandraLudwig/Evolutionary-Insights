Abstract:The Southwestern Atlantic (SWA) is one of the largest regional management units (RMUs) of the sea turtles Caretta caretta due to its unique mitochondrial lineages that are diverging from others worldwide. However, despite its importance, their life history remains elusive and poorly studied. Compiling mitochondrial (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) datasets, in this study, we retraced the SWA population history of this species through multidisciplinary approaches to deeply investigate the consequences of the evolutionary processes on its genetic  and demography patterns. The demographic results (i.e., migration and gene flow) evidenced that none of the nesting areas are genetically isolated but, indeed, the ES is the great propagule donor for other nesting areas, and it's highly connected with the BA nesting area, contradicting the previous hypothesis of the existence of the two (Reis et al., 2010) or three (Shamblin et al., 2014) genetic stocks in the SWA. Furthermore, the past Ne inferences point to recent bottleneck events for the C. caretta populations of the SWA, and that each nesting area presents a unique demographic history with distinct genetic signals that influence their current population structure and Ne.
